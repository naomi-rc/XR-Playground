# XR Playground

Welcome to XR Playground, a Unity XR project for exploring and experimenting with XR technologies and ideas! This project is developed in the context of the Let's Build XR Quest: 30 Day Quest, where we embark on a journey to enhance our skills and knowledge in the world of Extended Reality (XR).

## Project Overview
XR Playground serves as a centralized hub for various XR sub-projects developed throughout the 30-day quest. It's a place to dive into different XR concepts, such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), object tracking, hand tracking, haptics, and more. Each sub-project focuses on a specific XR application or experience in order to learn and implement diverse XR functionalities.
